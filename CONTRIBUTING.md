The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to kotal dashboard.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to help@kotal.co.

## What Can I Contribute?

Dashboard is an open-source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community ‚Äî you!
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog post about kotal, improving the documentation,
submitting bug reports and feature requests, or supporting new blockchain deployment,which can be incorporated into the [kotal operator](https://github.com/kotalco/kotal) itself.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

1. Install [kotal operator](https://github.com/kotalco/kotal)
2. Clone and run our [core-api](https://github.com/kotalco/core-api)
3. Check out the [open issues](https://github.com/kotalco/dashboard/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
4. Read the [README](README.md) for the necessary background on the project.
5. Familiarize yourself with the dashboard codebase and the contribution process.

## Contribution Flow

Here's how you can contribute to the project:

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine.
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch: `git checkout -b feature/my_new_feature`.
4. **Write or adapt tests** as needed.
5. **Ensure** that your code adheres to the existing style of the project to maintain consistency (e.g., using `prettier` for formatting).
6. **Ensure** your code compiles and passes all tests.
7. **Write or update documentation** as necessary.
8. **Submit** a pull request to the upstream dashboard repository.
9. **Include a clear description** of the problem and solution. Include any relevant issue numbers in your commit message (e.g., `Fixed #123`).

### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kotalco/dashboard/issues/new); it's that easy!
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code if you're able.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the dashboard, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

As with bugs, use the GitHub issues to submit your enhancement suggestions.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestions are related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

1. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
2. **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
3. **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
4. **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
5. **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most kotal users.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Before sending a pull request, always open an issue to discuss what you would like to change.
